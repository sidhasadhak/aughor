"""Runtime feature flags — operator-toggleable, env-var fallback.

A handful of capabilities ship off-by-default because they cost (per-table version
probes, prompt-content capture). They were previously env-only (e.g.
`AUGHOR_SNAPSHOT_RECEIPTS`), so an operator had to restart the process to flip them.
This stores an override in the kernel ledger kv so the UI can toggle them at runtime;
when no override is set, the env var still decides.

`flag_enabled(name)` is the resolver the feature code calls. The override is read from
SQLite per call (one indexed kv read — negligible; these aren't ultra-hot paths).

    # strategy §4G): the always-challenge tier was superseded by the materiality-gated
    # auto tier below, had no constituency, and a deleted flag is the only disposition

    # "obs.prompt_capture" (AUGHOR_OBS_PROMPT_CAPTURE) was DELETED 2026-08-01 (flag
    # endgame, verdict sheet Wave 1). The capability stays — it is how a recorded run
    # becomes a reproducible bug report — but a standing switch over the most sensitive
    # content this product writes is a control that depends on somebody remembering to
    # close it. Replaced by a self-expiring WINDOW (aughor/obs/prompt_window.py,
    # POST/GET/DELETE /obs/prompt-capture) bounded by a call budget AND a clock.
    # "deep_analysis.evidence_stubs" (AUGHOR_DEEP_ANALYSIS_EVIDENCE_STUBS) was DELETED
    # 2026-08-01 (flag endgame, verdict sheet Wave 1): it rendered already-scored
    # results as row-capped stubs — deliberately showing the model FEWER rows to save
    # tokens, the opposite of the evidence-budget direction, and its own description
    # forbade graduation without the A/B that was never bought. Its lossless sibling
    # (evidence_dedup) carries the whole win.
    # "search.rrf" (AUGHOR_SEARCH_RRF) was DELETED 2026-08-01 (flag endgame, verdict
    # sheet Wave 1): the RRF fusion was MEASURED worse than the α-blend default on the
    # real KB corpus (MRR 0.964 vs 0.977, recall@1 0.931 vs 0.957). The instrument was
    # `aughor/evals/rrf_retrieval_eval.py`, removed with the flag because it toggled the
    # flag to build its two arms and cannot run without it. It is RECOVERABLE at
    # `git show e094603:aughor/evals/rrf_retrieval_eval.py` (branch
    # worktree-flag-experiment-queue) — naming the commit rather than only the deletion
    # is what keeps a settled decision re-checkable by somebody who doubts it later.
    # hybrid_rerank now α-blends unconditionally.
    # RESTORED 2026-08-04, after Wave 3's adversarial review. This one was NOT redundant
    # with its trigger, and the difference is the whole lesson: the trigger answers a DATA
    # question ("do the two readings of this metric diverge?"), while the flag answers a
    # DEPLOYMENT question ("does this deployment want to be interrupted about it?").
    # Unwrapped, a divergent ratio metric pauses the run — `_stream_investigation` emits
    # `clarify_pending`, calls `pause_investigation` and returns WITH NO REPORT — so a
    # headless or batch consumer that never POSTs /feedback got a truncated run where it
    # previously got an answer. Nine of the ten guards only added cost when elevated; this
    # one blocks. Default-ON (the interactive product behaviour), operator can opt out.
    # DELETED 2026-08-04 (flag endgame Wave 3) — the NINE AUTO_ELIGIBLE self-gating guards
    # that WERE redundant with their own triggers, now unconditional. The AUTO_ELIGIBLE
    # tombstone carries the reasoning. Retired variables:
    #   deep_analysis.premise_check  (AUGHOR_PREMISE_CHECK)
    #   deep_analysis.adversarial_high_stakes  (AUGHOR_DEEP_ANALYSIS_ADVERSARIAL_HIGH_STAKES)

    #   ask.overview  (AUGHOR_ASK_OVERVIEW)
    #   ask.conversation_context  (AUGHOR_ASK_CONVERSATION_CONTEXT)
    # "capabilities.auto" (AUGHOR_CAPABILITIES_AUTO) was DELETED 2026-08-04 (flag endgame
    # Wave 3): it was a master switch over the ten AUTO_ELIGIBLE guards, and those are
    # unconditional now, so it governed nothing. See the AUTO_ELIGIBLE tombstone.
    # "explorer.continuous" (AUGHOR_EXPLORER_CONTINUOUS) turned ON and was DELETED
    # 2026-08-06 (flag endgame Wave 4, user-approved 2026-08-01): the continuous tick
    # always runs on an always-on process — spend is governed by the per-connection
    # decision in explorer/continuous.py (governance + AUTO_EXPLORATION gates, the
    # staleness window, the per-run exploration budget), which is where a cost control
    # belongs; a boolean over a governed loop was a second, blunter budget. Under
    # VERCEL the loop does not start at all (api.py) — a warm serverless instance is
    # not a clock, and a spawned exploration would die with it.
    # "automations.adopt_legacy" (AUGHOR_AUTOMATIONS_ADOPT_LEGACY) turned ON and was
    # DELETED 2026-08-06 (flag endgame Wave 4, user-approved 2026-08-01): monitors and
    # brief subscriptions run through the ONE automation engine — the legacy per-object
    # APScheduler cron paths were deleted in the same change, so there is nothing left
    # for the flag to stand down. The L4 equivalence receipt (65364174a172, 9/9 stable
    # ×3: alerts byte-for-byte, anti-flap and no-double-fire held) is what made the
    # flip safe; adoption_active() survives as the single consult point, hardwired True.

# ── Renamed flags (Wave W vocabulary unification) ─────────────────────────────────────
# A flag name is a CONTRACT with three independent holders: an operator's `.env`, a
# persisted runtime override row in the ledger kv, and any script passing the name to
# `flag_overrides`. Renaming the FLAG_ENV key alone silently strands all three — the
# operator's variable stops being read, the stored override stops being found, and the
# script raises UnknownFlagError. `MIGRATION` does not help: it is a disposition
# CATEGORY for two-code-path forks, not a rename facility.
#
# So a rename registers here instead of just editing FLAG_ENV, and every resolution
# path canonicalizes through it. Both maps EMPTY means the layer is inert and flag
# resolution is byte-identical to before it existed (asserted in the ratchet test).
#
# Retiring a name is a one-line move, never a deletion:
#   RENAMED["ada.parallel_lenses"] = "deep_analysis.parallel_lenses"
#   RETIRED_ENV["AUGHOR_ADA_PARALLEL_LENSES"] = "deep_analysis.parallel_lenses"

#: Retired flag name → its current name. Old names keep working; they never re-register
#: in FLAG_ENV (the ratchet asserts this, so a rename cannot be quietly reverted).

    # Three `ada.*` aliases left this map 2026-08-04: their targets
    # (deep_analysis.{premise_check, adversarial_high_stakes, pin_canonical_metric}) were
    # DELETED by flag endgame Wave 3, and an alias only means something while its target
    # lives — `_canonical` would resolve the old name to a flag no longer in FLAG_ENV, so
    # the alias adds a second dead name beside the dead one.
    #
    # Note what the hazard is NOT: an operator whose `.env` still exports the retired
    # variable gets `False`, not an exception. `UnknownFlagError` comes only from
    # `flag_overrides()`, which env vars never reach. The real risk runs the other way —
    # `flag_enabled` on an unregistered name silently returns False — which is why the
    # deletion sweep greps live CALL SITES, not just the registry.

    # not spell; the feature is "deep analysis" everywhere a human reads it. Call sites

    # Three more `ada.*` aliases left 2026-08-06: their targets
    # (deep_analysis.{parallel_lenses, parallel_phases, parallel_why_lenses}) were
    # deleted by flag endgame Wave 6 (transport-derived parallelism) — same rule as
    # the Wave 3 removals above: an alias only means something while its target lives.

    # left 2026-08-06 with their targets — flag endgame Wave 5 hardwired all three.
