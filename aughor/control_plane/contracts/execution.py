"""The query-execution result contract.

``QueryResult`` is what ``db.execute()`` and every connector return — so it must
live on the **platform** side, not inside the agent. Historically it was defined in
``aughor/agent/state.py``, which forced the data plane (``db`` / ``connectors``) to
``import`` the agent just to name a result — the wrong dependency direction for a
plug-and-play platform.

The type is a **hybrid** and deliberately kept whole (a clean move, zero behaviour
change):

  • **data-plane core** — ``sql``, ``columns``, ``rows``, ``row_count``, ``error`` —
    set by the executor / connectors;
  • **agent overlay** — ``hypothesis_id`` (an opaque audit/investigation label the
    platform already round-trips through the security gate), ``stats``,
    ``expected_if_true`` / ``expected_if_false`` — populated *post-hoc* by the
    investigation pipeline. The platform never reads these; it just carries them.

``aughor/agent/state.py`` re-exports both names, so existing agent imports
(``from aughor.agent.state import QueryResult``) are unchanged.
